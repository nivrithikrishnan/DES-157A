		<h1>Background Image 2</h1>
		<h2>Fixed Header Hero Image - With Resizing / No Cropping</h2>
			
		<p>On this example, as in the first example, you will notice that the content starts below the header image and scrolls on top of it. But this time, as you resize the browser window, the image at the top of the page resizes with the browser window and is NOT cropped. Also, you no longer have to be concerned that image will never go all the way to the edges of the browser window (unless you add padding to the left and right of the body element). However, it would still be advisible to use media queries to load proper sized images for different browser sizes.</p>
		
		<p><img src="images/bodyrule.png" alt="body rule css image" class="alignright">The magic that makes all this work, is found in two declarations in the body rule. The background-size declaration set to contain will make sure that the whole picture is displayed, no matter what. The second declaration that is important is the padding-top, which is set to a percentage. This percentage represents the proportion of the hight of the image to the width of the image.</p>
			
		<p>To find the correct percentage of height to width you could do the math ( height/width = x/100, cross multiply and divide to get the percentage. Or you can open the image in Photoshop and set the width to 100px to see what the height gets set to. That number will be your percentage.</p>
