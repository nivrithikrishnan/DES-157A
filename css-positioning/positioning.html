    <h1>Understanding Relative and Absolute Positioning in CSS</h1>
    <main>
        <article>
            <h2>Example 1</h2>
            <p>Below there is a parent element that is set to relative positioning. Inside that element is another
                element
                set to absolute postioning.</p>

            <p>Absolutely positioned items position relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. Since outerbox1 has
                <code>position: relative;</code> set, innerbox1, is positioned at the top right corner.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Experiment 1:</strong> Remove <code>position: relative</code> from the #outerbox1 rule and
                refresh the
                page. Notice that the red box goes to the top left corner of the browser window. This is because there
                is no positioned ancestor anymore, so the box is positioned relative to the window. </p>

            <p><strong>Experiment 2:</strong> Put <code>position: relative</code> back into the #outerbox1 rule and then
                change <code>top: 0;</code> and <code>left: 0;</code> in the #innerbox1 rule to <code>right: 0;</code>
                and <code>bottom: 0;</code> and you should see the red box move to the bottom right corner of the yellow
                box.</p>

            <p><strong>Experiment 3:</strong> Try setting different pixel amounts for the top or bottom properties, and
                left or right properties to see what you get. Try both positive and negative numbers for each. Notice
                you can not set BOTH the top AND bottom properties, or BOTH the left AND right properties. You can
                position the red box anywhere inside or outside the yellow box, using this coordinate system.</p>

            <p><strong>Experiment 4:</strong> Set the top property to -200px, and the left property to 300px on the
                #innerbox1 rule and notice that the red box is now covering the text in the paragrahs above the yellow
                box. This is because absolutely positioned elements are taken completely out of the flow of the document
                and are ignored by other elements.</p>

            <h2>Example 2</h2>

            <p><strong>Experiment 1:</strong> Add the top property and set it to -200px to the #innerbox2 rule. You will
                see that it moves the box, but it leaves a space where the box would normally display. For this reason,
                you don't usually use top/bottom or left/right properties with <code>position: relative;</code>. Usually
                <code>position: relative;</code> is just used to set a reference point for absolutely positioned
                elements, as shown in example 1 above.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Experiment 2:</strong> Change the positioning for #innerbox2 to <code>position: absolute;</code>
                to see what happens to the paragraph inside #outerbox2. You will see that when the positioning is
                switched, the paragraph now moves, because once #innerbox2 is set to absolute positioning, it is taken
                out of the flow of the document entirely.</p>

        </article>

        <div id="outerbox2">
            <div id="innerbox2"></div>
            <p>You can move elements that have <code>position: relative;</code> set on them with the top/bottom,
                left/right properties, but they leave a space where the element would normally be displayed. Notice this
                paragraph stays where it is, if you follow the instructions in the experiment above.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Example 3</h2>
            <p><strong>Experiment 1:</strong> Change the top property for #innerbox3 from 200px to -50px and see what
                happens. Because the parent element, #outerbox3 has <code>overflow: hidden;</code> set, anything
                overflowing that element (spilling outside it) is hidden, so only half the #innerbox3 is showing. This
                is useful for when you want to think of #outerbox3 as a stage that elements can enter and leave.</p>

            <p><strong>Experiment 2:</strong> Try setting <code>left: 50%;</code> and <code>top: 50%</code> on
                #innerbox3.
                You will see that puts the left side of the box half way across the #outerbox3 and the top of the box
                halfway down the #outerbox3.</p>

            <p><strong>Experiment 3</strong> Try adding <code>transform: translate(-50%, -50%);</code> to #innerbox3.
                This is a way of centering elements with absolute positioning. There are other ways of centering
                elements using CSS flexbox and Grid, but this is sometimes useful.</p>

            <h2>Example 4</h2>

            <p><strong>Experiment 1:</strong> In this example there are three absolutely positioned elements. Notice the
                third element is on top. That
                is because it loads last. Try adding <code>z-index: 1;</code> to #innerbox4a, and you should see it move
                to the top.</p>

            <p><strong>Experiment 2:</strong> Remove <code>z-index: 1;</code> from #innerbox4a and add
                <code>z-index: -1;</code> to #innerbox4c and you should see it move to the back. In fact, it looks like
                it disappeared entirely, but now it is behind #outerbox4.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Experment 3:</strong> Set <code>z-index: 1;</code> on #innerbox4a and set
                <code>z-index: 2;</code> on #innerbox4b and remove the z-index property (or set it to 0) on #innerbox4c.
                That will put the second box on top, then the first box, and then the third box on the bottom.
            </p>

            <p>The property, z-index, will only affect elements with some sort of explicit positioning set, such as
                <code>positoning: relative;</code> or <code>positioning: absolute</code>. Also, z-index is 0 by default
                and can be used with positive or negative integers to create a lot of layers within a stacking context.

            <h2>Bonus</h2>
            <p>Notice the <code>h1</code> is set to <code>position: fixed;</code>. I recommend you play around with the
                settings for the <code>h1</code> rules. Notice that <code>position: fixed;</code> also takes the element
                out of the flow of the document also, and so there is some additional margin on the body.</p>
