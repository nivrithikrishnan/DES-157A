            <h2>About Media Queries</h2>
            <p>Media queries allow us to change the layout and design of a project based on the viewport size. To create a media query, the code begins with '@media' followed by the desired vaue (ex: max/min width, hover, screen, print, etc.). </p>
            <p>Min-width is used to express the minimum condition for which the CSS should hold, and max-width the maximum. For example, a max-width set to 1250px would only be applied to viewport styples equal to or narrower than 1250px. </p>
            <p>We start with developing small screens first because there are ofte more details that need to be addressed with a mobile screen compared to one larger. In addition, it makes your project more accessible. </p>

            <h2>Relative Units</h2>
            <p>Relative units are used to make products more responsive as they are able to scale relative to the parent or window size. From a programming perspective, incorporating relative units allows for cleaner, simpler code as it reduces the need to update syling for different screen sizes. Some common units include '%' (relative to the parent's vale), 'em' (relative to the current font-size), 'rem' (relative to the root font-size), 'vh' (relative to the viewport height), and 'vw' (relative to the viewport width)</p>

            <h2>Meta Viewport Tag</h2>
            <p>We add the mets vieport tag to allow for mobile devices to render pages at a scaled width so it is sized correctly. Removing the tag renders the page at a desktop width size when the screen is scaled down, making the content more difficult to read and cut off at times.</p>
